# Spider at a glance:

From this workshop we hope that you have a good grasp of the purpose of the platform. You worked on several features independently so lets have a look at the full picture. You have:

- introduced to project spaces and run data analysis in these spaces
- made use of the project spaces collaborative features  
- used role-based access on Spider  
- ran data analysis with input/output data located on
   - your project space (on CephFS; Ceph File System)
   - to/from a large scratch area on local SSD
- launched a Notebook, installed packages within your Notebook or use existing software to run an analysis
- used a Singularity image with pre-installed software to run your workflows
- ran your analysis by fetching data on the fly directly from dCache with use of `dCache macaroons`
- run the same analysis on multiple platforms (no vendor lock-in)
