# Spider features you tested at a glance:

From this workshop we hope that you have a good grasp of the purpose of the platform. You worked on several features independently so lets have a look at the full picture. You have:

- an introduction to project spaces and run data analysis in these spaces
   - :+1: inherent organisation of your data, software and results
- made use of the project spaces collaborative features  
   - :relaxed: no data transfer and sharing overheads with your collaborators
- used role-based access on Spider 
   - :relieved: no more worrying about accidental deleting/overwriting of your data, software or results 
- ran data analysis with input/output data located on
   - your project space (on CephFS; Ceph File System)
   - to/from a large scratch area on local SSD
- launched a Notebook, installed packages within your Notebook or use existing software to run an analysis
   - :ok_hand: interactive post processing feature
- used a Singularity image with pre-installed software to run your workflows
   - :metal: software portablity and reproducability of your results
- ran your analysis by fetching data on the fly directly from dCache with use of `dCache macaroons`
   - :muscle: Integration with scalable external storage
- run the same analysis on multiple platforms (no vendor lock-in)
   - :vulcan_salute: Interoperability with existing platforms
