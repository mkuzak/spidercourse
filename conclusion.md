# Spider features you tested at a glance:

From this workshop we hope that you have a good grasp of the purpose of the platform. You worked on several features independently so lets have a look at the full picture. You have:

- an introduction to project spaces and run data analysis in these spaces
   - :+1: inherent organisation of your data, software and results
- made use of the project spaces collaborative features  
   - :relaxed: no data transfer and sharing overheads with your collaborators
- used role-based access on Spider 
   - :relieved: no more worrying about accidental deleting/overwriting of your data, software or results 
- ran data analysis with input/output data located on
   - your project space (on CephFS; Ceph File System)
   - to/from a large scratch area on local SSD
- launched a Notebook, installed packages within your Notebook or used existing software to run analysis
   - :ok_hand: interactive post processing feature
- used a Singularity image with pre-installed software to run your workflows
   - :metal: software portablity and reproducability of your results
- ran your analysis by fetching data on the fly directly from dCache with use of `dCache macaroons`
   - :muscle: Integration with scalable external storage
- ran the same analysis on another platform (no vendor lock-in)
   - :vulcan_salute: Interoperability with existing platforms

Spider is a high-throughput data-processing platform aimed at processing large structured data sets. Large scale analysis would mean not only a lot of data but also a lot of jobs to perform this analysis. It can get tricky to manage large number of jobs and the associated input data and results. Can you think of how you would automate your workflows? We can provide a demo if you like.
