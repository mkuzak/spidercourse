## Testing advanced features of Spider

### Running E-coli analkysis with advanced features

If you already ran the example with data and software management and data analysis, you are familiar with project spaces and 
various roles in a project and may start running the following examples directly. If you skipped these, here is a quick 
explanation of what analysis you will run in this section. The data in use is part of a long-term evolution experiment 
led by Richard Lenski to assess adaptation in E. coli. A population was propagated for more than 50,000 generations in a 
glucose-limited minimal medium. We will be working with three sample events from the Ara-3 strain of this experiment, 
one from 5,000 generations, one from 15,000 generations, and one from 50,000 generations to study how the population changed.
You will download a small set of data that has already been trimmed and will run the variant calling workflow using these additional 
features:

1. [Running analysis on local scratch space on worker nodes](https://github.com/sara-nl/spidercourse/blob/master/extras/tmpdir-usage.md)

2. [Running analysis with containers](https://github.com/sara-nl/spidercourse/blob/master/extras/singularity-usage.md)

3. [Accessing data from external storage systems](https://github.com/sara-nl/spidercourse/blob/master/extras/macaroons-usage.md)

## Testing advanced features with additional examples

1. Scientific catalogues (ND)

2. Jupyter notebooks (ND)

3. Infinite partition (ND)

4. Softdrive (ND - if possible)

5. fio example tmpdir cephfs (RO - for advisors pilot) also add massive scaling - pretty graphs
